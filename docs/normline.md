# Normline

Normline is the page where analysis of FELIX and OPO infrared data are processed such as baseline correction, wavelength and power calibration
In addition, one can do post-processing such as Gaussian and Multi-Gaussian line profile fitting fitting of experimental data to derive line parameters (FWHM, $\sigma$ and amplitude).

Before proceeding further, let us familirise with different data folder structure and processed and post-processed data types for FELIX and OPO IR data.

## Folder structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    Parent[parent-folder]

    Parent --> DATA
    Parent --> EXPORT
    Parent --> OUT
    
    DATA --> felix[.*felix]
    DATA --> .pow
    DATA --> .base

    EXPORT --> .dat

    OUT --> .expfit
    OUT --> .fullfit
    OUT --> other[.png, .pdf, etc]

```

???+ note "file types"
    .*felix indicates any of the following: .felix, .ofelix, .cfelix or .cofelix file

## Data types

| Name | Description | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| __FELIX__
| .felix   | FELIX IR data | Instrument (Labview) |
| .cfelix  | corrected felix | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| .pow     | powerfile for felix | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| .base    | baseline for felix | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| __OPO__
| .ofelix  | OPO IR data | Instrument (Labview) |
| .cbase   | baseline for OPO | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| .cofelix | corrected ofelix | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| __Post-processed__
| .dat    | processed .*felix data | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| .expfit | Gaussian fit parameters | created manually (FELionGUI) |
| .fullfit | Multi-Gaussian fit parameters | created manually (FELionGUI) |

## Step-by-step procedure

### Create baseline

Creating baseline for felix or opo IR spectrum

The procedure of processing the data are as given below in flowchart:

```mermaid
graph LR
  baseline[Create baseline] --> data[FELIX or OPO plot] --> post[Post processing]
```

As shown in above flowchart, the first step is to create a baseline

???+ info "Initial steps"
    The measured .*felix file is copied into a folder (called parent folder as mentioned in above flowchart) followed by baseline creation `Create baseline`.
    If the parent folder is empty the following directories `DATA`, `EXPORT` and `OUT` are automatically generated and the copied .felix or .ofelix files are copied into the `DATA` folder.

</figure>

???+ info "Baseline file selection"
    Normally files are selected by mouse `left-click`. However, to select a file for creating baseline one has to do `ctrl` + `left-click`.
    As shown in Fig 3, selected files are indicated by :fontawesome-regular-square-check: and the selected file for baseline correction has a solid orange coloured border.

???+ note "Baseline creation"
    If the `parent-folder` is empty and this is the first time you are processing the file, then after baseline creation you should refresh (:material-refresh:) and move into `DATA` folder.

???+ note "Baseline adjustment"
    As shown in Fig 4, the red coloured line is th measured FELIX data.
    While the blue coloured line corresponds to baseline which can be adjusted by dragging the solid-squared-blue-box.

The baseline is basicallya cubic spline extraploation w.r.t solid-squared-blue-box.
The solid-squared-blue-box  can be added or deleted, and the measured data (red coloured) can also be deleted and saved as a corrected felix file (.cfelix).

The addition and deletion can be applied when mouse is hovered over the region of interest followed by keyboard keys as shown in Table below.

| keys | description |
| --- | --- |
| `a` | add solid-squared-blue-box point |
| `d` | delete solid-squared-blue-box point |
| `x` | delete measured-data point |
| `z` | undo deleted measured-data point |
| `r` | redo deleted measured-data point |

### FELIX

#### Powerfile

Create powerfile (.pow) for corresponding (.felix) file

???+ warning "Powerfile saving"
    Don't leave an empty line at the end of the powerfile. It might cause an error.

#### FELIX plot

```mermaid
graph LR
  baseline[Create baseline] --> powerfile --> felix[FELIX plot] --> post-process
```

As shown above, once baseline is created click on `FELIX plot` button to analysis FELIX IR data (from .felix file).
